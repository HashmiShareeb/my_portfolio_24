      'During Industry Project i was assigned with a team of talanted developers and worked with Delaware. The Digital Patient Twin is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed to empower doctors with instant access to patient data. By providing a user-friendly interface, doctors can efficiently manage patient information and enhance patient care. Collaborating closely with my team members, I integrated backend data seamlessly into the frontend. This cohesive approach ensures that doctors receive accurate and up-to-date patient information. Due the company policy I can unfortunately not display the backend code online because of the company policy.',

I recreated the entire website using modern technologies such as Svelte, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and implemented i18n using Svelte Stores for locale and language management. On the internal 'My Harmony Dashboard', I worked on multiple core features including the dynamic device management page, onboarding flow (with GoLang autodetection script), energy forecasting charts, and a logging component. I also recreated complex KPI and monitoring graphs using Grafana and custom HTML panels. Throughout the project, I focused on clean code structure, API integration, and user experience improvements.",
