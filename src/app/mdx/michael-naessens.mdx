This was one of my first projects for a client named **Michael Naessens** who is a psychologist.
During my Intership in <Link target='_blank' className='text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300' rel='noopener noreferrer' href="https://www.indiegroup.be/">Exsited (now Indie Group)</Link> 
I made this website with the use of a PHP-based CMS called ProccesWire along with SCSS, VueJS, and CSS frameworks such as UIkit and Bootstrap. 

The focus for this project was to have a clean looking website to give the user a calm feeling
when visisting the website and also make it easy to navigate and find the information they are looking for.
