Based on the question: *"How can I use Spring Boot and hexagonal architecture to set up a REST API and integrate it into a Vue.js frontend with PostgreSQL?"*


This project explores that question through the design and implementation of Blitx, a **full-stack proof-of-concept dashboard** for managing autonomous vehicles (robotaxis). The primary focus of this project was on developing the backend,
specifically using **Spring Boot** to create a **RESTful API** that adheres to the principles of **hexagonal architecture**. The frontend was built with **Vue.js** to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend services.

Choosing autonomous vehicle as the domain was chosen because it naturally involves rich backend logic, such as ride requests, scheduling, vehicle state transitions, and routing, which makes it a strong fit for demonstrating the advantages of hexagonal architecture.

My research was to showcase that it is possible to use Spring Boot as a backend framework with hexagonal architecture principles to create a maintainable and testable REST API, while also integrating it with a Vue.js frontend for a complete full-stack application.
