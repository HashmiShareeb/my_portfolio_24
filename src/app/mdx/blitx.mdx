Based on the question: **"How can I use Spring Boot and hexagonal architecture to set up a REST API and integrate it into a Vue.js frontend with PostgreSQL?"**

The project involved setting up a Spring Boot backend with a REST API, implementing a PostgreSQL database, and developing a Vue.js frontend that consumes the API.
Blitx Robottaxi Dashboard is a scalable Full-Stack proof-of-concept project for managing autonomous vehicles. Designed with hexagonal architecture in mind and a primary focus on Spring Boot backend, the system supports two user roles and includes map integration via MapBox, as well as CRUD functionalities and other backend logic implemented in the Vue 3 frontend. Developed for research project with a focus on scalability and user-friendliness. This project also illustrates the importance of clean architecture and separation of concerns in software development.
