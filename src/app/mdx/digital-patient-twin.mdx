During Industry Project i was assigned with a team of talanted developers: **Jarne Delarue** and **Aléssia Vinnik**, and worked with <a href="https://www.delaware.pro/en" className='text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">**Delaware**</a>. The **Digital Patient Twin** is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed to empower doctors with instant access to patient data. By providing a user-friendly interface, doctors can efficiently manage patient information and enhance patient care. Collaborating closely with my team members, I integrated backend data seamlessly into the frontend. This cohesive approach ensures that doctors receive accurate and up-to-date patient information. Due the company policy I can unfortunately not display the backend code online because of the company policy.
