  Nexus FM is a project I made for the course **Advanced Full-stack development**. It was a project where I focused on property management tasks with role-based dashboards (Admin, Concierge, User), real-time rounds and checklists powered by GraphQL, and energy consumption tracking with the use of Vue-charts.
  Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, NestJS, GraphQL, and MongoDB, the project highlights my ability to design and implement a modern, full-stack application with live updates, responsive UI, and role-based workflows.


  ## Features
  - **Role-Based Dashboards**: Separate dashboards for Admin, Concierge, and User roles, each with tailored functionalities.
  - **Real-Time Rounds and Checklists**: Dynamic rounds for Concierges and checklists that updates.
  - **Energy Consumption Tracking**: Visualize energy usage with interactive charts.
  - **Maintenance Reporting**: Users can report maintenance issues directly through the platform.
  - **Property Management**: Admins can manage properties, users, and oversee system operations.


  ## Roles
  This project features three distinct user roles: **Admin**, **Concierge**, and **User**. Each role has specific functionalities tailored to their responsibilities within the property management system.
  - **Admin**: Manages users, properties, and oversees overall system operations.
  - **Concierge**: Conducts rounds, completes checklists, and manages day-to-day tasks given to them.
  - **User**: Can send maintenance reports, view property details.
